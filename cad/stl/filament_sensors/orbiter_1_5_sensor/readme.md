<img src="https://github.com/HelgeKeck/rome/blob/main/img/orbiter_15_sensor.jpg" alt="" width="480"/>

## BOM
- 1 x Micro Switch
- 1 x 6mm magnetic steel ball
- 1 x 5mm x 2mm N45 permanent round magnet
- 2 x M2x12mm screws 
- 2 x M2 hex nuts
- 1 x M6 PTFE fitting (you can use the one from the orbiter)

## Printing
- arachne
- 0.2mm first layer height
- 0.1mm base layer height
- part is already in the correct orientation
- put the magnet via print in place in its pocket

## Post processing
- remove sacrificial layer and clean the filament path
- the micro switch orientation matters, make sure the lever points to the small lever pocket
- make sure the sensor works, you can move it slightly to support more types of switches
